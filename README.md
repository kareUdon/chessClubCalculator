# Chess Club Score Calculator 

This is a Python script I made for my friends in chess club to calculate rankings and scores. It writes the stats to an Excel file. Will work on sorting the dictionary by the values soon, but this is finished!

# Requirements

Make sure to install xlsx module using pip, other than that, this should be easy to run. 

# Other notes

Some chess clubs have different ways of calculating scores. How we do it is we add the total wins and losses, add wins to that sum, and then subtract losses from it. It is a bit wacky, but if it's too wacky, you're free to use this and edit the formula in the code! :)
